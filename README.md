# Overview
A colleague has abruptly left the team to pursue a career as a novelist.
<br>
This colleague’s last days (and weeks) on the job were a mixed bag in terms of productivity.
<br>

Looking through the documents left behind there is some important contact info in the form of email addresses and phone numbers.
<br>

Unfortunately it’s mixed in with a bunch of useless notes.
<br>

Your job is to find the needles in the haystack.
<br>
